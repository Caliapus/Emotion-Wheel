# Emotions List
A webapp meant to trace and to monitor the emotions we're experiencing daily.

# What is this? 
Emotions List is an interactive web application that allows  to daily monitor the emotions. Users can navigate from a core emotion to its associated feelings and precise feelings, providing a way to understand, categorize and monitor their emotional experiences. The structure is from the wheel of emotions:

# How it works 
The classification of the emotions is kept in the emotion-data.js file. 
Each time the submit button is pressed, a line is added in feelings .csv with the date and the selected feelings. 

# How can I use it
Clone the repository to your local machine or to your web server.
Open index.html in a web browser to start exploring emotions.
If PHP is installed, a csv file should be saved. 

# To do
- write a proper README.md
- make it more presentable
- limit the number of emotions to be submited
- change the mechanics to make it nicer
